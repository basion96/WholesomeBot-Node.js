Everything will be alright.
Some days are brighter than others. Just because there are clouds today, doesn’t mean there won’t be sun tomorrow.
Know that you have friends and family around you. You have people around you, even when you feel alone. 
Life has a plan for you, even if you yourself don’t see it yet. Everything works itself out.
Some bad days are lessons in disguise. 
Try to see a positive in any given situation, even if it’s sarcastic, if it makes you laugh even a little, you’re on the right track.
