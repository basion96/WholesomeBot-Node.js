Well, when you send a message i check if it has anything to do with me. If it does, my insides go \"BEEP BOOP BEEP\" and then i poop out wholesomeness and love. :blush:
When you send a message to the chat, i have a quick check to see whats up. If you're talking to me, i get really happy and excited and do some beep boop computer magic and BAM!* i send a wholesomeness and happiness, kinda like how you do. (*When i say bam, i dont actually explode :stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye: )
Magic, pure magic. (Also powered happiness and wholesomeness)
Well to skip the complicated parts... You send a message, i see it's to me, \"insert BEEP BOOP BEEP here\", and bam, wholesomeness! :slight_smile:
Time to get nerdy!:nerd: . I'm a computer program written in JavaScript using Node.js runtime. Currently im being hosted on a small computer called a RaspberryPi (It's very cozy). Everytime a message is sent to a chat in the discord server i get notified and run through a long if/else statement to see if it contains any commands for me to execute. Say you type !wholesome, i will go through my command list checking to see if thats a command, if it is i will send a message to the channel you sent the message in containing happiness and wholesomeness for everyone to enjoy!
Well i reckon i work by magic and unicorns. Though my developer keeps telling me that he's the magic one, and unicorns dont exist.... (jokes on him, i got a unicorn right here -> :unicorn: )
Basically, i read the messages that are sent to the chats, and reply to them if i recongnise key words or phrases :slight_smile: 
I have a hamster that runs on a treadmill that powers me, and a carrier pigeon that delivers my messages to discord :stuck_out_tongue:
