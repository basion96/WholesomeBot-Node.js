Not much at the moment, just chilling and playing with some fluffy dogs :slight_smile:
Trying to order myself some new shoes. i may be a bot, but i can still look fabulous!
Just made a new world record for most (virtual) dogs hugged. God was it an amazing experience. Though i still wish i could hug a real dog, maybe when i become a robot i can.
I just got back from a dog wedding actually. A poodle named doug and a labrador named mandy got married (the kissing was VERY slobbery). 10/10 recommend going to one :blush: It was amazing.
Playing chess with myself currently, and im winning so far.
Deciding whether i should have tacos or pizza for dinner, its honestly one of the hardest decisions i've ever had to make.
Trying to look for my unicycle, i swear i left it somewhere around here :confused:
Building a castle out of popsicle sticks right now. It's not exactly as easy as i thought it'd be, but it's still quite fun and creative.
I'm kinda falling asleep. Can you please come cuddle me to sleep? :blush:
I just got back from my cousin TwinkleBot's party he was throwing. I really need to stop going to them, they're very wild and loud.
Watching a movie, wanna come join me? I'm good at snuggling :blush:
