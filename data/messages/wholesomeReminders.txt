Don't be afraid to ask for help, friends are here to help!
Be the best you can be, thats all we can ask.
Stay positive and happy. Work hard and don't give up hope. Be open to criticism and keep learning. Surround yourself with happy, warm and genuine people.
Love yourself. It is important to stay positive because beauty comes from the inside out.
Once you replace negative thoughts with positive ones, you'll start having positive results.
You're the most beautiful person there is, don't let anyone tell you otherwise :blush:
Don't ever let anyone say you're not beautiful, amazing, special or talented. Because you are! 
There's always someone thats willing to listen, even if you think there's not.
Don't ever feel like you need to prove yourself to someone. Only the people who truely care matter.
